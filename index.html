<p>Fact: im doing bachelor of IT but I don&rsquo;t know how to touch type XD</p>
<p style="color:Red"><strong>INTEREST IN I.T</strong></p>
<p><strong>My interest in IT? When my interest in IT started? Particular event or person that sparked my interest? My IT experience (if any). </strong></p>
<p>So how basically my whole life I never really knew what I wanted to be, even in year 12 when we&rsquo;re all putting in our courses for uni I still had no idea what to do. So at first I had like Commerce &amp; finance because I was sort of interested in the share market and stocks. But then comes around exam time last year, I&rsquo;ve played games on this potato computer my high school life, I had to move on. So I was like, I need a really huge present for myself for when my exams finish because you like we waited our whole lives to graduate. So I had enough and wanted a new pc, but not just go online or instore and buy a prebuilt&hellip;I wanted to build my own. With the help from my friend who knows a lot about computers, I got to learn about CPU&rsquo;s, graphics cards, RAM and a lot more which i started gradually got interested in I.T things.</p>
<p><strong>Why I choose to come to RMIT</strong></p>
<p>With the influence of other people and a lot of asking around, I asked monash or rmit for I.T? Some were like Monash for the &ldquo;name&rdquo; but I wasn&rsquo;t looking to flex on my friends. The others were like &ldquo;&hellip;..it&rsquo;s rmit&hellip;&hellip;.I.T is literally in the name of the uni&rdquo;. I was like hhm, u gotta point there. So I guess here I am now.</p>
<p>And honestly transport. One bus to the city is honestly a big deal and so much less Hussle than changing from bus to bus or train.</p>
<p><strong>What I expect to learn during my studies?</strong></p>
<p>Coding, and more coding.</p>
<p>Security/cybersecurity when I can start doing my chosen major because that&rsquo;s what I&rsquo;m interested in. As im interested in the dark side like hackers/black hats, white hats etc.</p>

<p><strong>A description of the position, and particularly what makes this position appealing to me.</strong></p>
<p>The things that got me interested in this position was that they had a certain role within the architecture team. I liked this as it felt like we would be working as a team and solving problems together rather than going to work everyday, sitting in front of a monitor everyday and just doing your own thing.</p>
<p>&ldquo;In this role you will be reporting to the Manager of Architecture&rdquo;, &ldquo;when IT Security Manager is absent, the Security Architect also&nbsp;assists in managing Security Operations function.&rdquo; Though I like doing whatever my authorities say, and what to achive there directions to my best ability, sometimes a also like to have a high position myself to teach or inform lower employees on how to do things. The feeling of being the one to help someone else develop is just as rewarding as being taught something new.</p>
<p><strong>A description of the skills, qualifications and experience required for the position.</strong></p>
<p>Skills required are to have Excellent verbal and written communication skills and have influencing and negotiation skills which indicate that there will be teamwork involved.</p>
<p>The experience you need is for someone with more experience than someone who has just graduated</p>
<p><strong>A plan describing how I will obtain the skills, qualifications and experience required for the position, building on those you have now.&nbsp;</strong></p>
<p>After my bachelor of I.T degree majoring in Security and cloud computing, I am planning to do a master of cybersecurity. I am willing to do internships, other smaller I.T jobs or positions to gather up more expe3rience to join a bigger company or position.</p>
<p style="color:Red"><strong>PERSONAL PROFILE</strong></p>
<p><strong>The results of an online Myers-Briggs test.</strong></p>
<img src = "mypersdonality.png">
<p>&ldquo;Advocates tend to see helping others as their purpose in life, but while people with this personality type can be found engaging rescue efforts and doing charity work, their real passion is to get to the heart of the issue so that people need not be rescued at all.&rdquo;</p>
<p><strong>The results of an online learning style test. (Education Planner)</strong></p>
<img src = "nso n.png">
<p><strong>&nbsp;</strong>&ldquo;You are a&nbsp;<strong>Visual/Tactile</strong>&nbsp;learner!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Visual</p>
<p>you learn by reading or seeing pictures. You understand and remember things by sight. You can picture what you are learning in your head, and you learn best by using methods that are primarily visual. You like to see what you are learning.</p>
<p>As a visual learner, you are usually neat and clean. You often close your eyes to visualize or remember something, and you will find something to watch if you become bored. You may have difficulty with spoken directions and may be easily distracted by sounds.</p>
<p>Tactile</p>
<p>If you are a tactile learner, you learn by touching and doing. You understand and remember things through physical movement. You are a "hands-on" learner who prefers to touch, move, build, or draw what you learn, and you tend to learn better when some type of physical activity is involved. You often communicate by touching, and you appreciate physically expressed forms of encouragement, such as a pat on the back.</p>

<p style="color:Red"><strong>PROJECT IDEA</strong></p>
<p>An app that notifies you when to do your Homework! Called &ldquo;&nbsp;Freedom is illegal &rdquo;</p>
<p>Sounds pretty dumb right? No. if you don&rsquo;t do your homework, you&rsquo;re the dumb one.</p>
<p>So how does it work?</p>
<p>High schools and universities all around Australia&rsquo;s have signed up to this app which makes it compulsory for all students to have.</p>
<p>Primary schoolers don&rsquo;t need access to this application as they have not yet been exposed to extreme usage, such as having their own phones are laptops, they also still have their mum watching over them 24/7.</p>
<p>When there is homework that is due or an upcoming test, the school/teachers would have put this up in the app (like rmit&rsquo;s announcements/canvas) which well determine when the app would give its notifications. With the students devices (phones and school laptops) all signed with this app, the teacher will put a &ldquo;desired&rdquo; timetable/ break the homework up to parts for the students to do daily to avoid the main goal of not getting students to procrastinate.</p>
<p>every school has each and every student in a system that links to there academic performance made into a ranking which will give positive reinforcement and incentives to those who are doing well or at the bottom who are going up.</p>
<p>So&hellip;..sounds like you can easy exploit or dodge this apps notifications right? Such as oh, I see the notification, who cares ill continue watching Netflix.</p>
<p>The app has been designed to see each and every students top most used apps ( don&rsquo;t worry, we don&rsquo;t see what they&rsquo;re doing on it) such as snapchat, YouTube etc, and lock it until the designated homework is complete.</p>
<p>P.S the school or teachers will be informed from the app if a student has deleted the app hehe.</p>
